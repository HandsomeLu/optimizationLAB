crores   xxi    the guns of the gods   xxii    making one hundred exactly   xxiii   three amber moons in a purple sky  xxiv   a hundred guarded it  xxv   and that is the whole story      guns of the gods    out of the ashes  old troy reaped rue in the womb of years for stolen helen s sake  till tenfold retribution rears its wreck on embers slaked with tears that mended no heart ache  the wail of the women sold as slaves lest troy breed sons again dreed o er a desert of nameless graves  the heaps and the hills that are trojan graves deep runneled by the rain   but troy lives on  though helen s rape and ten year hold were vain  though jealous gods with men conspire and furies blast the grecian fire  yet troy must rise again  troy s daughters were a spoil and sport  were limbs for a labor gang  who crooned by foreign loom and mill of trojan loves they cherished still  till homer heard  and sang   they told  by the fire when feasters roared and minstrels waited turns  of the might of the men that troy adored  of the valor in vain of the trojan sword  with the love that slakeless burns  that caught and blazed in the minstrel mind or ever the age of pen  so maids and a minstrel rebuilt troy  out of the ashes they rebuilt troy to live in the hearts of men      yasmini     set down my thoughts not yours if the tale is to be worth the pesa    the why and wherefore of my privilege to write a true account of the princess yasmini s early youth is a story in itself too long to tell here  but it came about through no peculiar wisdom   i fell in a sort of way in love with her  and that led to opportunity   she never made any secret of the scorn with which she regards those who singe wings at her flame   rather she boasts of it with limit overreaching epithets   her respect is reserved for those rare men and women who can meet her in unfair fight and  if not defeat her  then come close to it   she asks no concessions on account of sex   men s passions are but weapons forged for her necessity   and as for genuine love affairs  like cleopatra  she had but two  and the second ended in disaster to herself   this tale is of the first one that succeeded  although fraught with discontent for certain others   the second affair came close to whelming thrones  and i wrote of that in another book with an understanding due  as i have said  to opportunity  and with a measure of respect that pleased her   she is habitually prompt and generous with her rewards  if far seeing in bestowal of them   so  during the days of her short political eclipse that followed in a palace that had housed a hundred kings  i saw her almost daily in a room  her holy of holies  where the gods of ancient india were depicted in three primal colors working miracles all over the walls and where  if governments had only known it  she was already again devising plans to set the world on fire   there  amid an atmosphere of indian scents and cigarette smoke  she talked and i made endless notes  while now and then  when she was meditative  her maids sang to an accompaniment of rather melancholy wooden flutes   but whenever i showed a tendency to muse she grew indignant    of what mud are you building castles now   set down my thoughts not yours   she insisted   if your tale is to be worth the pesa    by that she referred to the custom of all eastern story tellers to stop at the exciting moment and take up a collection of the country s smallest copper coins before finishing the tale   but the reference was double edged  a penny for my thoughts  a penny for the west s interpretation of the east was what she had in mind   nevertheless  as it is to the west that the story must appeal it has seemed wiser to remove it from her lips and so transpose that  though it loses in lore unfortunately  it does gain something of directness and simplicity  her satire  and most of her metaphor if always set down as she phrased it  would scandalize as well as puzzle western ears   this tale is of her youth  but yasmini s years have not yet done more than ripen her   in a land where most women shrivel into early age she continues  somewhere perhaps a little after thirty  in the bloom of health and loveliness  younger in looks and energy than many a western girl of twenty five   for she is of the east and west  very terribly endowed with all the charms of either and the brains of both   her quick wit can detect or invent mercurial asian subterfuge as swiftly as appraise the rather glacial drift of western thought   and the wisdom of both east and west combines in her to teach a very nearly total incredulity in human virtue   western morals she regards as humbug  neither more nor less   in virtue itself she believes  as astronomers for example believe in the precession of the equinox   but that the rank and file of human beings  and especially learned human beings  have attained to the very vaguest understanding of it she scornfully disbelieves   and with a frankness simply gallic in its freedom from those thought conventions with which so many people like to deceive themselves she deals with human nature on what she considers are its merits   the result is sometimes very disconcerting to the pompous and all the rest of the host of self deceived  but usually amusing to herself and often profitable to her friends   her ancestry is worth considering  since to that she doubtless owes a good proportion of her beauty and ability   on her father s side she is rajput  tracing her lineage so far back that it becomes lost at last in fabulous legends of the moon  who is masculine  by the way  in indian mythology    all of the great families of rajputana are her kin  and all the chivalry and derring do of that royal land of heroines and heroes is part of her conscious heritage   her mother was russian   on that side  too  she can claim blood royal  not devoid of at least a trace of scandinavian  betrayed by glittering golden hair and eyes that are sometimes the color of sky seen over himalayan peaks  sometimes of the deep lake water in the valleys   but very often her eyes seem so full of fire and their color is so baffling that a legend has gained currency to the effect that she can change their hue at will   how a russian princess came to marry a rajput king is easier to understand if one recalls the sinister designs of russian statecraft in the days when india and  warm sea water  was the great objective   the oldest  and surely the easiest  means of a perplexed diplomacy has been to send a woman to undermine the policy of courts or steal the very consciences of kings   delilah is a case in point   and in india  where the veil and the rustling curtain and religion hide woman s hand without in the least suppressing her  that was a plan too easy of contrivance to be overlooked   in those days there was a prince in moscow whose public conduct so embittered his young wife  and so notoriously  that when he was found one morning murdered in his bed suspicion rested upon her   she was tried in secret  as the custom was  found guilty and condemned to death  then  on the strength of influence too strong for the czar  the sentence was commuted to the far more cruel one of life imprisonment in the siberian mines   while she awaited the dreaded march across asia in chains a certain proposal was made to the princess sonia omanoff  and no one who knew anything about it wondered that she accepted without much hesitation   less than a month after her arrest she was already in paris  squandering paper rubles in the fashionable shops   and at the russian embassy in paris she made the acquaintance of the very first of the smaller indian potentates who made the  grand tour    traveling abroad has since become rather fashionable  and is even encouraged by the british indian government because there is no longer any plausible means of preventing it  but maharajah bubru singh was a pioneer  who dared greatly  and had his way even against the objections of a high commissioner   in addition he had had to defy the brahman priests who  all unwilling  are the strong supports of alien overrule   for they are armed with the iron fanged laws of caste that forbid crossing the sea  among innumerable other things   perhaps there was a hint of moral bravery behind the warrior eyes that was enough in itself and she really fell in love at first sight  as men said  but the secret police of russia were at her elbow  too  hinting that only one course could save her from extradition and siberian mines   at any rate she listened to the rajah s wooing   and the knowledge that he had a wife at home already  a little past her prime perhaps and therefore handicapped in case of rivalry  but never the less a prior wife  seems to have given her no pause   the fact that the first wife was childless doubtless influenced bubru singh   they even say she was so far beside herself with love for him that she would have been satisfied with the gandharva marriage ceremony sung by so many rajput poets  that amounts to little more than going off alone together   but the russian diplomatic scheme included provision for the maharajah of a wife so irrevocably wedded that the british would not be able to refuse her recognition   so they were married in the presence of seven witnesses in the russian embassy  as the records testify   after that  whatever its suspicions  the british government had to admit her into rajputana   and what politics she might have played  whether the russian gray coat armies might have encroached into those historic hills on the strength of her intriguing  or whether she would have seized the first opportunity to avenge herself by playing russia false   are matters known only to the gods of unaccomplished things   for bubru singh  her maharajah  died of an accident very shortly after the birth of their child yasmini   now law is law  and sonia omanoff  then legally the princess sonia singh  had appealed from the first to indian law and custom  so that the british might have felt justified in leaving her and her infant daughter to its most untender mercies   then she would have been utterly under the heel of the succeeding prince  a nephew of her husband  unenamored of foreigners and avowedly determined to enforce on his uncle s widow the indian custom of seclusion   but the british took the charitable view  that covering a multitude of sins  it was not bad policy to convert the erstwhile sonia omanoff from secret enemy to grateful friend  and the feat was easy   the new maharajah  gungadhura singh  was prevail
